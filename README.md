## Theory of Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.  
The element that is inserted **first** is the one that gets **removed first**.

### Characteristics:
- Elements are **inserted at the rear** (enqueue).
- Elements are **removed from the front** (dequeue).
- Supports sequential access, not random access.
- Can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or STL in C++.

### Types of Queues:
1. **Simple Queue** â€“ Follows basic FIFO order.
2. **Circular Queue** â€“ Last position connects back to the first, avoiding wasted space.
3. **Priority Queue** â€“ Elements are dequeued based on priority, not order of insertion.
4. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)** â€“ Insertion and deletion allowed from both ends.

### Applications:
- CPU scheduling
- Disk scheduling
- Printer task management

| Feature               | Array                                | Stack                               | Queue                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory. | A linear data structure that follows **LIFO** (Last In, First Out). | A linear data structure that follows **FIFO** (First In, First Out). |
| **Access Method**      | Direct/random access using index.    | Access only from **top**.            | Access at **front** (deletion) and **rear** (insertion). |
| **Insertion**          | Anywhere using index.                | Push operation (only at top).        | Enqueue operation (only at rear).    |
| **Deletion**           | Anywhere using index.                | Pop operation (only from top).       | Dequeue operation (only from front). |
| **Order of Processing**| No fixed order.                      | Last element inserted is first removed. | First element inserted is first removed. |
| **Memory Use**         | Fixed size (static).                 | Fixed size (if array-based).         | Fixed size (if array-based).         |
| **Applications**       | General-purpose storage.             | Expression evaluation, function calls (recursion). | Scheduling, BFS traversal, resource management. |

## Summary
- **Array** â†’ Provides random access but no strict rule for insertion/deletion.  
- **Stack** â†’ Restricts operations to **one end (top)** and follows **LIFO**.  
- **Queue** â†’ Restricts operations to **two ends (front & rear)** and follows **FIFO**.  

## Algorithm for Queue Implementation

1. Define a class `Queue` with:
   - Array `arr[SIZE]` to store elements.
   - Two integer pointers: `front` and `rear`.

2. Initialize:
   - `front = -1`
   - `rear = -1`

3. Enqueue (Insert element):
   - If `rear == SIZE - 1`, print "Queue Overflow" (queue full).
   - If `front == -1`, set `front = 0` (first element).
   - Increment `rear` and insert element at `arr[rear]`.

4. Dequeue (Remove element):
   - If `front == -1` OR `front > rear`, print "Queue Underflow" (queue empty).
   - Else, print `arr[front]` as removed.
   - Increment `front`.

5. Display (Print queue elements):
   - If `front == -1` OR `front > rear`, print "Queue is empty".
   - Otherwise, loop from `front` to `rear` and print elements.

6. In `main`:
   - Create a queue object.
   - Perform enqueue, dequeue, and display operations to test functionality.

- Call center systems
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs

## Conclusion

- A **queue** is a fundamental data structure based on the FIFO principle.  
- The given code implements a **simple queue using arrays** with operations:
  - **Enqueue** â†’ Insert at rear.
  - **Dequeue** â†’ Remove from front.
  - **Display** â†’ Print all elements from front to rear.  
- This implementation demonstrates how to handle **overflow** (when full) and **underflow** (when empty).  
- While array-based queues are easy to implement, they have limitations (fixed size).  
- More advanced versions like **circular queues** or **linked list-based queues** can overcome these drawbacks.
